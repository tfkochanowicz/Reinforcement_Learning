# Reinforcement_Learning
Overview: This was a project I created in an Artificial Intelligence class, it primarily focuses on fundamental concepts in Reinforcement learning.
This project is based on a open source project from UC Berkley, and you can read the description of the problems solved in this project here: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa19/project3/. It covers concepts including: Value Iteration, Markov Decision Processes, Q-Learning, and much more(the link
provided will give a more in depth description). This application was ran with **Python version 3.9**.

How to run the app?: I would recommend using Pycharm, but this project will likely work with any IDE that has Python(3.9) that is setup correctly. The link provided also shows you commands to run different aspects of this program in the **Python Console**. This Application also includes an autograder, and my project scored a 25/25.

How does this program work, and what does it do?: Initially this program is a template, where I needed to implement the logic behind different Artificial intelligence programs. One of the main focuses of this project is Implementing algorithms for pacman to beat the game or score higher than a human could (pacman is an unsolved game, similar to chess). There is also algorithms that I implemented for the bridge crossing problem, and the Q-Learning crawler robot. I highly recommend reading through this link: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa19/project3/ if you want to get a deeper understanding of this project of each the 10 problems in this project, as even one algorihtm by itself can be pretty complex without that background knowledge.
